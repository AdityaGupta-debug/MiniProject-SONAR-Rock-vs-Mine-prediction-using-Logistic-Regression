📄 Dataset Description – Sonar Rock vs Mine 🪨💣
This dataset contains sonar signal returns collected by bouncing sound waves off different objects. The main objective is to classify whether the object is a Rock (🪨) or a Mine (💣) based on the reflected sonar signals.

The dataset has 60 numerical features (🧪), each representing the strength of the returned sonar signal at a specific frequency.

These signals were recorded using a fixed sensor, and each feature has a value between 0 and 1 (🎚️).

The target label is:

"R" for Rock (🪨)

"M" for Mine (💣)

Total samples: 208

Type: Binary Classification

🧠 Model Used – Logistic Regression (📈➡️📉)
To classify sonar signals into rocks or mines, I used Logistic Regression, a linear model that predicts probabilities between 0️⃣ and 1️⃣. It’s ideal for binary classification tasks like this and helps determine how likely a sonar return is from a mine 💣 or a rock 🪨 based on its signal pattern.
